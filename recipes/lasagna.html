    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with rich meat or vegetable sauce,
        creamy ricotta cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan, then baking it until bubbly and golden. The dish is known for
        its hearty, comforting flavors and satisfying layers, making it a favorite in many households. Traditionally,
        lasagna is made with a tomato-based meat sauce, but variations include white sauce (béchamel), vegetarian
        versions with spinach and mushrooms, or even seafood-based recipes.</p>

    <p>Originating from Italy, specifically from regions like Emilia-Romagna, lasagna has evolved into different styles
        worldwide. The traditional <em>Lasagna alla Bolognese</em> uses a slow-cooked ragù (meat sauce) and béchamel instead
        of ricotta, while American-style lasagna typically includes ricotta and more mozzarella for a cheesier texture.
        Whether homemade or store-bought, lasagna is a beloved dish that brings people together, perfect for family
        dinners, holidays, or special occasions.</p>
